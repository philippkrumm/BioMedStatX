# Excel Templates and Sample Files

This file points to the sample Excel template(s) you can use to try the HowTo and ANOVA examples.

- Repository template (moved): `docs/StatisticalAnalyzer_Excel_Template.xlsx` — this file is recommended for testing and examples. If you do not yet see it in `docs/`, run the move script from the repository root:

	- Unix/macOS: `./scripts/move_template.sh`
	- Windows (cmd): `scripts\move_template.bat`

- Precompiled builds: some release bundles (Windows/macOS) include a template named `BioMedStatX_excel_template.xlsx`. If you downloaded a release, you may find that copy in the release assets or the application package.

Which one to use?

- Use `docs/StatisticalAnalyzer_Excel_Template.xlsx` to follow the documentation examples in `docs/HowTo.md` and `docs/ADVANCED_ANOVA_GUIDE.md`.
- If the file is not yet in `docs/`, run one of the scripts above to move it from the repository root into `docs/`.

How to open it:

- In Excel (Windows/macOS): double-click the `.xlsx` file.
- In LibreOffice (Linux): `libreoffice --calc StatisticalAnalyzer_Excel_Template.xlsx`

If you want me to copy the template file into `docs/` as a repository file (duplicate), tell me and I will add it in the next step.
